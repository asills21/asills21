 <p>Wildflowers are found all throughout the world and often in the most unexpected places! Some wildflowers native to the Pacific Northwest are yarrow, columbine, milkweed, and Indian Paintbrush. 
    Woodland wildflowers, many of which are unique to this region, abound in the shady forests, while desert and grassland species thrive in the warm, dry conditions of the interior valleys and coastal areas offer a completely different palette of wildflowers.
